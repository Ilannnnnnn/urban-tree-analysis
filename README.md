# Saint-Quentin Urban Tree Analysis

This repository contains the code for an application designed to study and analyze the urban tree heritage of the city of Saint-Quentin (Aisne). The project combines various aspects of **Big Data**, **Artificial Intelligence**, **Web Development**, and **Database Management** to provide a comprehensive tool for the processing and visualization of tree-related data.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Process large datasets related to the city's urban tree heritage.
- Develop an interface for data visualization and insights into tree health, distribution, and types.
- Apply AI techniques for tree data analysis and predictive modeling.

## Data

The full dataset used in this project is available publicly on [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/patrimoine-arbore/). For this repository, we have extracted a smaller portion of the data for the purpose of demonstration and local development.

If you wish to work with the complete dataset, you can download it directly from the link above.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization of tree types, locations, and health status
- AI-driven analysis and predictions on urban tree management
- Web interface to interact with the data and generate insights

## Technologies Used

- Python (for data processing and AI)
- JavaScript/HTML/CSS (for the web interface)
- SQL/NoSQL (for database management)
- Libraries: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Flask (or Django for web development)
